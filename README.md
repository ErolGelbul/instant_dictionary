<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Getting Started

Instant Dictionary is a web application that I built back when I wanted to push my applications to the web.
Although the project is still in a local production environment, it was one of my starting projects before
deploying any app. The project follows a OOP design pattern. This was the first time I built a simple API
with basic documentation.

Another feature of this application is that it outputs the results instantly, which I never imagined would
be possible since my understanding of get() requests were only based on initilisation of user inputs.

I chose to use JustPy for the frontend since it only uses Python instead of the general frontend technologies,
such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. For designing the navigation bar and the banner, I used the Quasar framework.


To run the web app:

1. Install the files
2. Run main.py to start JustPy
3. Launch in on your browser.
4. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.
